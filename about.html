    <p class= "orange_section_paragraph"> My name is Georgie and I am a complete coding beginner. Over the next 8 weeks I will be learning to code using HTML and CSS with CodeFirst:Girls. </p>
    <p class= "orange_section_paragraph"> I haven't had much, if any exposure to coding and programming before but there's no time like the present to learn a new skill! </p>
    <p class= "orange_section_paragraph"> On April 1st, I start my new graduate role as UX Content Designer and what better way to prepare than to learn front end programming. </p>
    <p class= "orange_section_paragraph"> I'm really excited to see where the next 8 weeks takes me and hope you'll enjoy the journey with me!</p>
